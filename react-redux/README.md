## Overview of CRUD Application with Redux and Redux Toolkit

This application leverages **Redux** and **Redux Toolkit** to efficiently manage state for all CRUD operations. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

### 1. **Store** 
The Redux store (defined in `store.ts`) serves as the **single source of truth** for the application state. It uses the tasks reducer to manage the tasks state.

### 2. **Slice** 
We use Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` function to define a **slice** of state for tasks. This slice includes the reducer and action creators, handling all CRUD operations seamlessly.

### 3. **Async Thunks** 
We handle asynchronous operations such as fetching, adding, updating, and deleting tasks using `createAsyncThunk`. These thunks automatically dispatch actions to handle the **pending**, **fulfilled**, and **rejected** states of each asynchronous request.

### 4. **Reducers** 
The tasks slice includes reducers that respond to actions dispatched by the async thunks, ensuring the state is updated based on the success or failure of each operation.

### 5. **Selectors** 
Selectors are used in components to **extract specific pieces of state** from the Redux store, keeping the components only dependent on the necessary parts of the state.

### 6. **Hooks** 
We provide typed custom hooks (`useAppDispatch` and `useAppSelector`) to interact with the Redux store. These hooks simplify working with dispatch and selecting state.

### 7. **Components** 
React components interact with the Redux store using these hooks. Components can dispatch actions to update the state and use selectors to access data from the store for rendering.

### 8. **Error Handling** 
An `ErrorBoundary` component is implemented to catch and display any errors that occur in the React component tree.

---

## Key Benefits

- **Full CRUD Operations**: The application supports Create (adding tasks), Read (fetching and displaying tasks), Update (editing tasks and toggling completion), and Delete (removing tasks).
- **Separation of Concerns**: Redux logic is encapsulated within slices, keeping the React components focused on UI concerns.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Redux Toolkit's `createAsyncThunk` simplifies asynchronous operations by managing loading, success, and error states.
- **Immutability**: Redux Toolkit uses **Immer** under the hood, enabling us to write simple update logic that appears to mutate the state, but actually produces immutable updates.
- **Error Handling**: Errors are handled both at the Redux level (for API calls) and at the React component level using an `ErrorBoundary`.

This setup demonstrates how to structure a Redux-based application with Redux Toolkit to manage CRUD operations in a scalable and maintainable way.

## Introduction

This Task Manager application is a comprehensive React project that demonstrates the use of Redux and Redux Toolkit for state management. It includes features such as task creation, editing, deletion, filtering, searching, and pagination. The application also implements responsive design and dark mode.

## Redux and Redux Toolkit Implementation

### Store Setup

The Redux store is set up using Redux Toolkit's `configureStore` in `src/store/store.ts`:

```typescript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import tasksReducer from '../features/tasks/tasksSlice';
import uiReducer from '../features/ui/uiSlice';

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    tasks: tasksReducer,
    ui: uiReducer,
  },
});

export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>;
export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;
```

### Slice Pattern

We use Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` to define reducers and action creators. Example from `src/features/tasks/tasksSlice.ts`:

```typescript
const tasksSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'tasks',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    setFilter: (state, action: PayloadAction<FilterStatus>) => {
      state.filter = action.payload;
      state.currentPage = 1;
    },
    // ... other reducers
  },
  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    builder
      .addCase(fetchTasks.pending, (state) => {
        state.status = 'loading';
      })
      // ... other cases
  },
});
```

### Async Thunks

For asynchronous actions, we use `createAsyncThunk`:

```typescript
export const fetchTasks = createAsyncThunk('tasks/fetchTasks', async () => {
  const response = await api.fetchTasks();
  return response;
});
```

### Custom Hooks

We define custom hooks in `src/store/hooks.ts` for typed Redux usage:

```typescript
import { TypedUseSelectorHook, useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import type { RootState, AppDispatch } from './store';

export const useAppDispatch = () => useDispatch<AppDispatch>();
export const useAppSelector: TypedUseSelectorHook<RootState> = useSelector;
```

## Component Overview

### TaskList

The main component that displays the list of tasks and handles pagination:

```typescript
export const TaskList: React.FC = () => {
  const dispatch = useAppDispatch();
  const tasks = useAppSelector((state) => state.tasks.items);
  // ... other state selections

  useEffect(() => {
    if (status === 'idle') {
      dispatch(fetchTasks());
    }
  }, [status, dispatch]);

  // ... filtering and pagination logic

  return (
    <div>
      <TaskStats />
      <FilterBar />
      <SearchBar />
      {paginatedTasks.map((task) => (
        <TaskItem key={task.id} task={task} />
      ))}
      <Pagination totalItems={filteredTasks.length} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

### TaskItem

Represents a single task and handles task updates and deletion:

```typescript
export const TaskItem: React.FC<{ task: Task }> = ({ task }) => {
  const dispatch = useAppDispatch();

  const handleToggleComplete = () => {
    dispatch(updateTask({ ...task, completed: !task.completed }));
  };

  const handleDelete = () => {
    dispatch(deleteTask(task.id));
  };

  // ... render task item
};
```

## Styling

The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Global styles are defined in `src/styles/globals.css`:

```css
@import 'tailwindcss/base';
@import 'tailwindcss/components';
@import 'tailwindcss/utilities';

@layer base {
  body {
    @apply antialiased;
  }
}

@layer components {
  .animate-fade-in-up {
    animation: fadeInUp 0.3s ease-out;
  }
}

@keyframes fadeInUp {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(20px);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}
```

## Testing

We use Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests. Example test for the tasks slice:

```typescript
import tasksReducer, {
  setFilter,
  setSearch,
  fetchTasks,
} from './tasksSlice';

describe('tasks reducer', () => {
  const initialState = {
    items: [],
    status: 'idle',
    error: null,
    filter: 'all',
    search: '',
    currentPage: 1,
    itemsPerPage: 5,
  };

  it('should handle initial state', () => {
    expect(tasksReducer(undefined, { type: 'unknown' })).toEqual(initialState);
  });

  it('should handle setFilter', () => {
    const actual = tasksReducer(initialState, setFilter('active'));
    expect(actual.filter).toEqual('active');
    expect(actual.currentPage).toEqual(1);
  });

  it('should handle setSearch', () => {
    const actual = tasksReducer(initialState, setSearch('test'));
    expect(actual.search).toEqual('test');
    expect(actual.currentPage).toEqual(1);
  });

  it('should handle fetchTasks.pending', () => {
    const action = { type: fetchTasks.pending.type };
    const state = tasksReducer(initialState, action);
    expect(state.status).toEqual('loading');
  });

  // ... more test cases
});
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`
4. Run tests: `npm test`

## Best Practices

1. Use the slice pattern for organizing Redux logic
2. Leverage Redux Toolkit's utilities like `createSlice` and `createAsyncThunk`
3. Implement custom hooks for typed Redux usage
4. Use async thunks for handling asynchronous actions
5. Implement proper error handling and loading states
6. Write unit tests for reducers and components
7. Use Tailwind CSS for consistent and responsive styling
8. Implement accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
9. Use React's built-in performance optimization techniques (memo, useCallback, useMemo)

By following these practices and referring to this project structure, you can efficiently implement Redux and Redux Toolkit in your future React applications.
